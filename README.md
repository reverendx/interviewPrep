# interviewPrep
## Can we go from 0 to FAANG Hero?
### This repo aims to be a compilation of problems, resources, etc. Basically a reference guide to beginner and intermediate software developers.


## Leetcode's 75
### Consists of a list of 75 Leetcode problems to teach you *most* of what you need to know to ACE that first interview and LAND your first Software dev job.

### I will be grouping these problems by concepts, this is helpful for practicing a certain subject but also to identify patterns and hopefully this also helps us to get more comfortable withem. (I will be adding a checklist because this is a guide for you just as much as it is mine :P)
