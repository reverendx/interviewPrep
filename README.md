## Can we go from 0 to FAANG Hero?
This repo aims to be a compilation of problems, resources, etc. Basically a reference guide to beginner and intermediate software developers.

## Whoami & why even listen to me?
I wish this section started off with **_"I'm a succesful 6digits entrepeneur talented software engineer..."_** but that's not the case, in fact if this wins your interest and it's within your capabilities, you're welcome to collaborate in this project. I consider myself a beginner. I understand most of the basics but I've been trapped in the wonderful [tutorial hell](https://medium.com/@adrian.td96/what-is-tutorial-hell-d24c1bdb279f). I believe that with the right amount of pracitce _anyone_ can understand and solve these type of problems. Let's try!

[Leetcode's 75](url) | Key factors to consider and _remember_ when solving each problem. | Pick a problem, instead of trying to memorize my terrible code go through the _notes_ section and try it for yourself. My recommendation would be to _at least_ try to solve a problem a day.ðŸ¥‡

## Leetcode's 75
Consists of a list of 75 Leetcode problems to teach you *most* of what you need to know to ACE that first interview and LAND your first Software dev job.

**Disclaimer: I will be grouping these problems by subjects to identify patterns and hopefully this also helps us to get more comfortable withem. (I will be adding a checklist because this is a guide for you just as much as it is mine** 

**ps: I will only be using python.**
